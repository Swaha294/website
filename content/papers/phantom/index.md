In this project, we will analyse, ‘The Phantom of the Opera’, a number in the eponymous musical. We will try to analyse musical choices made by the composer and the singers - the instruments used, the tonal quality of the singers, pitch, rhythm and other such musical elements. Through this, we hope to both understand and explain why this piece has kept garnering such worldwide praise and popularity for more than 40 years.
