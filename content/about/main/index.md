 Hi! I am a senior double majoring in Mathematics & Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College, a historically all women's college in Northampton, Massachusetts. I enjoy learning about data science, statistics, application of mathematical methods, quantitative research, and machine learning methods, among other things. You can learn more about my projects by visiting the [projects](/project/) tab or viewing my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Swaha294). 
  
  Outside of college, I spend my time singing (my [singing channel](https://www.instagram.com/swa_laalaalaa/)), making LEGO models, reading, learning new instruments, and learning new things.
  
  Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto::itsswahabhattacharya@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swaha294/)!
