  Hi! I am a Data Scientist at HSB, a reinsurance company, where I leverage statistical modeling, machine learning methods, and GenAI to develop ethical data-driven solutions to business problems. I have a keen interest in learning about the mathematical theory behind the models I develop, while also learning to navigate through perspectives of people from different backgrounds to create a unified solution. 
  
  Before this, I graduated with a double major in Mathematics, and Statistical and Data Scienes from Smith College. You can learn more about my projects by visiting the [projects](/projects/) tab or viewing my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Swaha294). 
  
  Outside of college, I spend my time [singing](https://www.instagram.com/swa_laalaalaa/), making LEGO models, reading, learning new instruments, and doing yoga.
  
  Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto::itsswahabhattacharya@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swaha294/)!
