`complexR` is a tool for easily computing and visualizing transformations 
and stereographic projections on complex numbers. The package allows users to 
visualize such transformations on a multiple domains, including circles, discs, 
and quadrilaterals. 

- `circle_transform()` performs and visualizes any kind of transformation on 
circles

- `line_transform()` performs and visualizes any kind of transformation on lines

- `quad_transform()` performs and visualizes any kind of transformation on 
squares and rectangles

- `disc_transform()` performs and visualizes any kind of transformation on discs

- `plane_to_sphere()` and `sphere_to_plane()` compute stereographic projections

- `st_sphere_plot()` and `st_plane_plot()` visualize them.
