`ipl` is an R data package that provides data and functions related to the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches and standard cricket statistics. This package allows users to avail of IPL data and conduct analysis of cricketers and IPL teams using functions of this package.

I presented an e-poster about the `fec16` package at the [Women in Statistical and Data Sciences 2020 conference](https://github.com/mariumtapal/presentations/blob/master/wsds-2020/wsds_2020_poster.pdf) and at the [Electronic Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference](https://rawgit.com/mariumtapal/presentations/blob/master/eUSR-2020/pres.html).
