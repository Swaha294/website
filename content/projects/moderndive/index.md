The `moderndive` R package consists of datasets and functions for [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)-friendly introductory linear regression. These tools leverage the well-developed `tidyverse` and `broom` packages to facilitate

  1. Working with regression tables that include confidence intervals
  
  2. Accessing regression outputs on an observation level (e.g. fitted/predicted values and residuals)
  
  3. Inspecting scalar summaries of regression fit (e.g. R-squared, R-squared adjusted, and mean squared error)
  
  4. Visualizing parallel slopes regression models using ggplot2-like syntax.
  
This R package is designed to supplement the book “Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse” available at [ModernDive.com](https://moderndive.com/).
